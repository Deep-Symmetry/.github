# Deep Symmetry

Our open-source projects are organized here on GitHub.

## Star History

Here is one way to see how many people have been discovering the
projects over time. To avoid hammering the GitHub API, this is a
static image, but if you click on it you can see an up-to-date version
(you may need to supply your own GitHub API token if you do it
frequently):

We have not had time to perform shows since 2016, so we aren't using
afterglow any longer, but it is still the repository people are most
excited about.

Most of the time we used to spend performing has been devoted to
beat-link-trigger and the related repositories that underpin it, which
many interesting artists are using to synchronize visuals and lighting
with DJ performances.
