# Deep Symmetry

Our open-source projects are organized here on GitHub. They fall into
a few distinct categories:

* [afterglow](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/afterglow) is a
  [Clojure](https://clojure.org) live-coding environment for creating
  and running light shows with DMX and ArtNet fixtures. It led toâ€¦

* [dysentery](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/dysentery), another
  Clojure project for exploring how to integrate performances with
  Pioneer DJ modular music performance gear. Its primary value is the
  language-independent [protocol analysis
  documentation](https://djl-analysis.deepsymmetry.org/) we published,
  and which has been used by multiple projects to create such
  integrations in a variety of programming languages. Our own
  implementation is:

* [beat-link](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link), for which
  we dropped down from Clojure to Java to make it more accessible to
  by other developers in the JVM ecosystem. Although we find Clojure
  to be much faster and more expressive and safe as a development
  language, not all developers are familiar with it, so slowing down
  to offer this as a pure Java library made it easier for Java,
  Kotlin, and other JVM communities to use. Publishing this library
  led someone to ask us to create:

* [beat-link-trigger](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/beat-link-trigger),
  an integration environment for shows using beat-link, initially a
  demonstration of how one could send MIDI events in response to DJ
  actions and in sync with beats, it has grown into far more, and is
  our primary focus today, providing an on-ramp to performing
  musicians and their tech crews, who are not primarily software
  developers, to explore what is possible.

Over time these main projects spawned sub-projects, split out so that
people who only needed parts of the functionality could use them
separately. See [below](#component-projects) for descriptions of them.

## Star History

Here is one way to see how many people have been discovering the
projects over time. To avoid hammering the GitHub API, this is a
static image, but if you click on it you can see an up-to-date version
(you may need to supply your own GitHub API token if you do it
frequently):

We have not had time to perform shows since 2016, so we aren't using
afterglow any longer, but it is still the repository people are most
excited about.

Most of the time we used to spend performing has been devoted to
beat-link-trigger and the related repositories that underpin it, which
many interesting artists are using to synchronize visuals and lighting
with DJ performances.

## Component Projects

As described above, here are other projects which feed into the
primary ones mentioned above, but are designed to be usable on their
own as well:

* [carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/carabiner) is a small
  C++ program that can be used as a loose bridge to [Ableton
  Link](https://www.ableton.com/en/link/) for people who want to be
  able to synchronize with performances over that protocol.

* [lib-carabiner](https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/lib-carabiner) is a
  Java library which allows Carabiner to be embedded in a Java
  program, extracting and running the appropriate executable for the
  processor architecture and operating system that is detected.
